# 4.7 Exceptions

## Key takeaways

1. In Python, there is a distinction between two kinds of errors:

    - syntax errors (parsing errors), which occur when the parser comes across a statement that is incorrect. For
      example:
      Trying to execute the following line:

      ```
      print("Hello, World!)
      ```

      will cause a SyntaxError, and result in the following (or similar) message being displayed in the console:

      ```
      File "main.py", line 1

      print("Hello, World!)
                          ^
      SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal
      ```
      Pay attention to the arrow – it indicates the place where the Python parser has run into trouble. In our case,
      it's the missing double quote. Did you notice it?

    - exceptions, which occur even when a statement/expression is syntactically correct; these are the errors that are
      detected during execution when your code results in an error which is not unconditionally fatal. For example:
      Trying to execute the following line:

      ```
      print(1/0)
      ```
      will cause a ZeroDivisionError exception, and result in the following (or similar) message being displayed in the
      console:

      ```
      Traceback (most recent call last):
        File "main.py", line 1, in 
          print(1/0)
      ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
      ```
      Pay attention to the last line of the error message – it actually tells you what happened. There are many types of
      exceptions, such as ZeroDivisionError, NameError, TypeError, and many more; and this part of the message informs
      you of what type of exception has been raised. The preceding lines show you the context in which the exception has
      occurred.

2. You can "catch" and handle exceptions in Python by using the try-except block. So, if you have a suspicion that any
   particular snippet may raise an exception, you can write the code that will gracefully handle it, and will not
   interrupt the program. Look at the example:

   ```
   while True:
       try:
           number = int(input("Enter an integer number: "))
           print(number/2)
           break
       except:
           print("Warning: the value entered is not a valid number. Try again...")
   ```
   The code above asks the user for input until they enter a valid integer number. If the user enters a value that
   cannot be converted to an int, the program will print Warning: the value entered is not a valid number. Try again...,
   and ask the user to enter a number again. What happens in such a case?

    1. The program enters the while loop.
    2. The try block/clause is executed. The user enters a wrong value, for example: hello!.
    3. An exception occurs, and the rest of the try clause is skipped. The program jumps to the except block, executes
       it, and then continues running after the try-except block.
       If the user enters a correct value and no exception occurs, the subsequent instructions in the try block are
       executed.

3. You can handle multiple exceptions in your code block. Look at the following examples:

   ```
   while True:
       try:
           number = int(input("Enter an int number: "))
           print(5/number)
           break
       except ValueError:
           print("Wrong value.")
       except ZeroDivisionError:
           print("Sorry. I cannot divide by zero.")
       except:
           print("I don't know what to do...")
   ```

   You can use multiple except blocks within one try statement, and specify particular exception names. If one of the
   except branches is executed, the other branches will be skipped. Remember: you can specify a particular built-in
   exception only once. Also, don't forget that the default (or generic) exception, that is the one with no name
   specified, should be placed at the bottom of the branch (use the more specific exceptions first, and the more general
   last).

   You can also specify and handle multiple built-in exceptions within a single except clause:

   ```
   while True:
       try:
           number = int(input("Enter an int number: "))
           print(5/number)
           break
       except (ValueError, ZeroDivisionError):
           print("Wrong value or No division by zero rule broken.")
       except:
           print("Sorry, something went wrong...")
   ```

4. Some of the most useful Python built-in exceptions are: ZeroDivisionError, ValueError, TypeError, AttributeError, and
   SyntaxError. One more exception that, in our opinion, deserves your attention is the KeyboardInterrupt exception,
   which is raised when the user hits the interrupt key (CTRL-C or Delete). Run the code above and hit the key
   combination to see what happens.

   To learn more about the Python built-in exceptions, consult the official Python documentation.

5. Last but not least, you should remember about testing and debugging your code. Use such debugging techniques as print
   debugging; if possible – ask someone to read your code and help you find bugs in it or to improve it; try to
   isolate the fragment of code that is problematic and susceptible to errors: test your functions by applying
   predictable argument values, and try to handle the situations when someone enters wrong values; comment out the parts
   of the code that obscure the issue. Finally, take breaks and come back to your code after some time with a fresh pair
   of eyes.
